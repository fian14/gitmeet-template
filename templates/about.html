Such practices provide a basis for upcoming developers and not only save their time but increase overall efficiency of the organization.</div><div class="description">Since I pressed button on the computer for the first time, I fell in love with the underlying technology that powers entire world as of today. Unfortunately I couldn't get computer science at any IIT but that didn't stop me follow my passion. In second year of the college, I won web design competition organized by Director Office for development of IIT Indore's website. That led me work on various institutional projects and personal websites.</div><div class="description">After graduation, I went to Delhi to work on my own startup but I am not much of a business person. I like to work alone or small group people who are smarter than me and let other people take care of the business. To become a people person, you need to understand employee management and team association, hence I took at job at HelpChat (Akosha back then) as a front end developer. That was the best decision I ever made. That made me change my perception toward people, a team and an organization as a whole.</div><div class="description">Today, I work with small team to help people build their dream homes through an online platform 'ArchiBiz'. It's still under development phase. I try to learn everyday and contribute back to the community at 'www.github.com/thatisuday'. I am just a beginner and I wish to know more everyday.
